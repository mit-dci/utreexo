/*

Implementation of the ChainHook interface, which should be enough to
plug a wallet into.

type ChainHook interface {

	Start(height int32, host, path string, proxyURL string, params *coinparam.Params) (
		chan lnutil.TxAndHeight, chan int32, error)
	RegisterAddress(address [20]byte) error
	RegisterOutPoint(wire.OutPoint) error
	UnregisterOutPoint(wire.OutPoint) error
	PushTx(tx *wire.MsgTx) error
	RawBlocks() chan *wire.MsgBlock
}

Also, what's an "address"...?  Guess use whatever btcd uses.  Or just []byte,
but that's annoying because you might not have a 1:1 mapping with a PkScript...

When it starts, it should return 2 channels: a height channel of int32s which
just sends a number which pretty much just ticks up each block, and a channel of
txs, which come *before* the height where they're confirmed.  Could also have
a separate unconfirmed TX channel if there's interest in that...e
