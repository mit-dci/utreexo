# utreexo

utreexo is a novel hash-based dynamic accumulator, which allows the millions of unspent outputs to be represented under a kilobyte -- small enough to be written on a sheet of paper. There is no trusted setup or loss of security; instead, the burden of keeping track of funds is shifted to the owner of those funds.

Currently, transactions specify inputs and outputs, and verifying an input requires you to know the whole state of the system. With utreexo, the holder of funds maintains a proof that the funds exist and provides that proof at spending time to the other nodes. These proofs represent the utreexo modelâ€™s main downside; they present an additional data transmission overhead that allows a much smaller state.

utreexo pushes the costs of maintaining the network to the right place: an exchange creating millions of transactions may need to maintain millions of proofs, while a personal account with only a few unspent outputs will only need to maintain a few kilobytes of proof data. utreexo also provides a long-term scalability solution as the accumulator size grows very slowly with the increasing size of the underlying set (the accumulator size is logarithmic with the set size)
